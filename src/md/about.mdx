# ¬°Welcome to Chukuto Planet! üåç

## Originsüîé

The university blog "Chukuto Planet" was created by a group of students of the **Universidad Nacional Experimental de la Gran Caracas (UNEXCA)**, passionate about technological innovation belonging to FL11211-C2 section, conducted a search for an unusual name, until inspiration came from the nickname of **Profesor Chucuto**, who was known for his preference for well synthesized and easy to understand works, or "chucutos", as he called them. Profesor Chucuto was an advocate of the idea that complex information can be simplified to make it more accessible and easier to understand. Whenever one of the students handed in a paper he used to say; that everything was "chucuto", meaning that it was incomplete or inefficient which is generally used in Venezuelan slang, specifically in rural areas. However, over time, students learned to appreciate this criticism, and began to focus on doing more dynamic and very intuitive work.

The students, after inquiring more about the word found inspiration in the traditional song from the plains of Venezuela called "El Caim√°n Chucuto" performed by a Venezuelan musician named **Santiago Rojas**, whose lyrics in this song symbolize the struggle for equality and respect towards all living beings. They were also inspired by the fictional newspaper "Daily Planet" from the Superman comics, which was known for its focus on truth and justice, but the students added the letter "k" replacing the letter "c" to give a unique and distinctive touch to this peculiar name, it is necessary to understand that the letter "K and C" are letters that represent the sound **/k/**, the phonetic pronunciation of the sound /k/ is spelled as "kei" in the international phonetic alphabet (IPA). The "K" is used more in words of Greek, Latin or foreign origin, while the "C" is used more in words of Anglo-Saxon, French or Spanish origin.
